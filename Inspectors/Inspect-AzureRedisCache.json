    "FindingName": "Azure Cache for Redis Non-SSL Ports Configured",
    "Description": "Azure Cache for Redis, unlike Redis server, natively supports TLS. By default, non-SSL ports are disabled. Some Redis clients do not support TLS, leading to the non-default configuration returned in this finding. Although some clients do not work with TLS, it is possible to use a utility like stunnel to proxy the connection securely.",
    "Remediation": "Validate the current configuration is expected and appropriate. If non-SSL ports are not necessary for day-to-day operations, it is recommended to disable the ability to use non-SSL ports.",
