	"FindingName": "Blobs allow public access",
	"Description": "Public access allows for anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs. The storage accounts context configuration specifies the level of public access to this container. By default, the container and any blobs in it can be accessed only by the owner of the storage account. To grant anonymous users read permissions to a container and its blobs, you can set the container permissions to enable public access. Anonymous users can read blobs in a publicly available container without authenticating the request.\nThe acceptable values for this parameter are:\n--Container. Provides full read access to a container and its blobs. Clients can enumerate blobs in the container through anonymous request, but cannot enumerate containers in the storage account.\n--Blob. Provides read access to blob data in a container through anonymous request, but does not provide access to container data. Clients cannot enumerate blobs in the container by using anonymous request.\n--Off. Restricts access to only the storage account owner.",
	"Remediation": "Disable public access for storage accounts, unless it is a business requirement. If public access is required, monitor anonymous requests using Azure Metrics Explorer.\nTo change access levels:\nGo to \"Storage Accounts\" > select the affected storage account, select Containers under \"Data Storage\" > select the resources and select \"change access level\" at the top of the page > change the Public access level drop down to \"Private (no anonymous access)\"\nAlternatively, the following PowerShell commands can be run on each of the affected blobs:\nSet-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName \"$ResourceGroupName\" -Name \"$StorageAccountName\" -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false",
