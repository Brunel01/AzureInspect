    "FindingName": "Storage Accounts Allow Public Access",
    "Description": "Public access is configured for the identified storage accounts. This non-default configuration, if explicitly configured, can allow for anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs. ",
    "Remediation": "Disable public access for storage accounts, unless it is a business requirement. If public access is required, monitor anonymous requests using Azure Metrics Explorer.\nTo change access levels:\nGo to \"Storage Accounts\"&rarr;select the affected storage account, select Containers under \"Data Storage\"&rarr;select the resources and select \"change access level\" at the top of the page&rarr;change the Public access level drop down to \"Private (no anonymous access)\"\nAlternatively, the following PowerShell commands can be run on each of the affected blobs:\nSet-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName \"$ResourceGroupName\" -Name \"$StorageAccountName\" -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false",
